 *Program description:
 *This program is going to be the background portion of our game
 *it showcases a variety of orange fish cycling across the screen. 
 The background.js file also functions as the "hub" for our code
 as it initializes and brings all of the other aspects of the 
 progam to the scene.

A person responsible for this file should
design the background as well as
initalize the character and obstalce by calling those functions and
call the update functions for the character and the obstacle*/
